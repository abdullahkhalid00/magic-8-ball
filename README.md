# Magic 8 Ball in Python ðŸŽ±

A very basic implementation of the magic 8 ball game that simply asks the user for a question and replies from a fixed list of answers randomly.

## Usage

Open up  a terminal and clone the repository.

```bash
git clone <repo-link>
```

Navigate to the cloned repo directory.

```bash
cd 8_ball
```

Play by running `main.py`.

```bash
python main.py
```

> Note: Make sure the `response.txt` is in the same directory as `main.py`.
